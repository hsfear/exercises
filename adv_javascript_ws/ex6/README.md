# Instructions

1. In this exercise, you will revisit your work from exercise 5 (the note taking app). You will need to copy in your fixed code from "ex5.js" into the "ex6.js", as your starting point.

2. Identify places where your event handler bindings are creating "unintended closures", and rearrange the code to avoid this pitfall.

3. What are the benefits of rearranging your event handlers into separate functions like this? What are the tradeoffs?
